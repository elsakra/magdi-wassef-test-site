Hormones are your body's chemical messengers, affecting everything from your energy and mood to your metabolism and sleep. When they're out of balance, you feel it.

## Signs of Hormone Imbalance

- Fatigue that doesn't improve with rest
- Weight gain, especially around the midsection
- Mood swings, anxiety, or depression
- Difficulty sleeping or poor sleep quality
- Low libido or sexual dysfunction
- Brain fog and difficulty concentrating
- Hair loss or skin changes

## Our Approach to Hormone Health

We don't just look at one hormone in isolation—we assess your entire hormonal symphony. This includes:

### Comprehensive Testing

We use advanced testing to get a complete picture of your hormone levels, including:

- Full thyroid panel (not just TSH)
- Sex hormones (estrogen, progesterone, testosterone)
- Adrenal hormones (cortisol, DHEA)
- Metabolic hormones (insulin, leptin)

### Root Cause Analysis

Hormone imbalances often stem from underlying issues like gut dysfunction, chronic stress, nutrient deficiencies, or environmental toxins. We identify and address these root causes.

### Personalized Protocols

Your treatment plan may include:

- Targeted nutritional support
- Lifestyle modifications
- Stress management techniques
- Bio-identical hormone replacement (when appropriate)
- Ongoing monitoring and adjustments

## What to Expect

Your hormone health journey begins with comprehensive testing and a deep dive into your symptoms and health history. From there, we create a personalized plan to restore balance and help you feel like yourself again.
