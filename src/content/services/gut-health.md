Your gut is the foundation of your health. It's where you absorb nutrients, produce neurotransmitters, and house 70% of your immune system. When your gut isn't functioning optimally, it affects everything.

## Signs Your Gut Needs Support

- Bloating, gas, or irregular bowel movements
- Food sensitivities that seem to be increasing
- Skin issues like acne, eczema, or rashes
- Brain fog and difficulty concentrating
- Mood issues like anxiety or depression
- Autoimmune conditions
- Frequent illness or infections

## Our Gut Health Approach

We use advanced testing and proven protocols to identify what's happening in your gut and create a personalized plan to heal it.

### Comprehensive Testing

- **GI-MAP Testing**: Advanced stool analysis that looks at your microbiome, pathogens, digestion markers, and gut inflammation
- **SIBO Breath Testing**: Identifies small intestinal bacterial overgrowth
- **Food Sensitivity Testing**: Helps identify which foods may be contributing to inflammation

### The 5R Protocol

Our gut healing approach follows the proven 5R framework:

1. **Remove**: Eliminate triggers including inflammatory foods, pathogens, and stressors
2. **Replace**: Support digestion with enzymes, acid, and bile support as needed
3. **Reinoculate**: Restore beneficial bacteria with targeted probiotics and prebiotics
4. **Repair**: Heal the gut lining with targeted nutrients and supplements
5. **Rebalance**: Address lifestyle factors like stress, sleep, and movement

## What to Expect

Gut healing is a journey, not a quick fix. Most clients begin to see improvements within 4-8 weeks, with significant progress over 3-6 months. We'll work together to find the pace that works for your body and your life.
